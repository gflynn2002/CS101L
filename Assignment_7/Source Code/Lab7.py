## Program #6

## PROBLEM : In this lab weâ€™ll write a program to read through a file containing information about fuel economy and output the results to a file above a threshold that the user gives.
##  If the user wants to see all vehicles with a combined mpg greater than 50, then yourprogram will output that information to the file of their choosing.
##  The information is tab-delimited.  When you read a line from the file, the values are separated by the tab character \t.  
##
## ALGORITHM : 
##      First setup input to ask for file, then open that in 'w' mode. Then create open = 0, set to 0 for every loop(it is used on year, and the mpgs) ask for all sections of
##      the spread sheet. Then use f.write with {} formatting so you can use all variables at once. Then close it.
## 
## ERROR HANDLING:
##      Must use exact text file name.
##
## OTHER COMMENTS:
##      None
